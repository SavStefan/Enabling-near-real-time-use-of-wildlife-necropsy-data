# Enabling-near-real-time-use-of-wildlife-necropsy-data
Source files for the application described in the manuscript titled 'Enabling near real-time use of wildlife necropsy data: Text-mining approaches to derive interactive dashboard displays.'
'global.R', 'ui.R', and 'server.R' files must be downloaded and stored within the same directory. All three files opened simultaneously in an IDE for the statistical software package 'R', such as R-Studio or similar. After installing all packages within the global.R file, a user can run the files as an application. Alternatively, a browser-based version of the application can be accessed at 'https://stefansav.shinyapps.io/necropsy-text-mining-2/'. The 'Sample data.csv' file can then be uploaded into the application. Basic instructions on use are provided within the application itself.
