Avian Malaria",,,"This bird was very skinny but was also infected with the protozoal organism Plasmodium, the causative agent of Avian Malaria, a disease spread by mosquitoes. 
I think the main reason for the the bird's emaciated state is due to a lack of foraging (being a juvenile bird, they don't always know the best places to forage, and in some years the amount of prey available is reduced). This has likely then made the bird more susceptible to the Plasmodium infection. Some birds can carry this organism is small numbers and remain perfectly healthy, but if their immune system becomes suppressed (in this case due to the bird's declining body condition), then the Plasmodium organism can take advantage and start to cause illness. In the case of this bird, the Plasmodium organism has mostly targeted the bird's lung. 
Avian Malaria can not be transmitted to humans, so there is no risk to anyone who had any contact with this bird, dead or alive.

They showed no obvious signs of undue stress during the six hour journey. 
The birds were held overnight to let them recover from the journey, they were put together in a cool dark place and fed each two small yellow-eyed mullet that evening and another one next morning before release.

When released together Colonel took several steps toward the sea, looked back at us, looked to see if Henry was following then waded into the water, splashed around a bit then swam slowly out to sea. A near perfect release. She was last seen about 15 minutes later several hundred metres offshore heading seawards. 
Henry would/could not stand upright, we tried holding him upright hoping he would gain his balance, he did not, he was panting, stressed and after a few minutes we placed him under rocks in the shade a metre or two from and within sight of the water, and we retreated leaving him in peace.

On gross post mortem the lungs were deep red and oozed frothy fluid and the histology of the lung is consistent with pulmonary oedema (fluid on the lungs); there was no clear indication of a pneumonia.
Histology of the heart show contraction band necrosis of the myocardium, which is usually associated with high levels of catecholamines (e.g. adrenaline) as can occur with high levels of stress (such as transport, hyperthermia). Necrosis refers to the death of a cell, which in this case refers to the death of cells within the heart muscle (the myocardium). The fluid on the lung is likely the combination of stress and declining heart function. 
( just as an aside, contraction bands can be seen be seen as an artifact of fixation of the heart but it is usually much more widespread in the myocardium and I believe the changes seen in the heart of this bird are real).
In summary, unfortunately the death of this bird is most likely the result of stress, which can lead to fluid on the lung. Stress may also result in the death of the heart muscle, which will also indirectly result in fluid on the lung"

A cause of the foot wounds is not readily apparent given they have been present for more than a few days, but we have seen similar wounds to the feet of Yellow Eyed Penguins recently and barracuda have been the suggested cause.

The source of the blood is not clear but may be due to damage to the vascular system (rather than a lacerated blood vessel or intestinal tract). Many of the organs, most noticeably the liver, were quite autolysed which could indicate the bird had a high temperature when he died or possibly a Clostridial infection.
There looked to have been a perforation and ""abscess"" formation at the proximal oesophagus which could be several days old. This could have predisposed to an aspiration event result in the pleuritis and airsacculitis (it looked more bacterial than fungal). I'm having trouble putting all these things together but hopefully histology will help with this (unfortunately some of the organs were a bit autolysed as previously mentioned). "

In parts of the intestine there has been damage to the lining which could have resulted in malabsoprtion of nutrients, but since the bird will not have been foraging during the moult it is difficult to be sure of it's significance; however the damage is real and recent and are similar to changes reported in other birds, such as geese, infected with parvo-virus. 
Other changes reported with parvo-virus include atrophy the spleen and bursa which this bird also has, but atrophy of these organs also occurs with emaciation. There are also changes to this bird's pancreas which have also been described with parvo-virus, however other described changes to the heart and liver were not observed.
So it is possible this bird has also had some disease in conjunction with the moult-induced emaication, which is possibly viral which has contributed to the bird's demise. A formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded section of intestine was negative for Herpes on PCR."

Although Plasmodial organisms were difficult to see on histology of the internal organs this is likely due to this penguin dying during the sexual stage of the Plasmodium. The sexual stages (which are the final stages of development) of Plasmodium only occur in the red blood cells (erythrocytes) and these are not readily visible on histology. The sexual stage results in destruction of Plasmodial-infected erythrocytes and inflammation, which is what I am seeing in this penguin. The earlier (asexual) stages of Plasmodium are usually visible on histology. Because I am not seeing many of these asexual stages this probably indicates this bird has survived the initial (asexual) stages of infection but succumbed to the later (sexual)  stages of infection.

The oral mucous membranes and tongue were white, and the dorsal surface of the feet were pale. 
Over the dorsal pelvis, there was a healed circular wound just left of midline with associated alopecia and metaplastic feather growth. 
The cloaca was distended and contained watery fluid with granular fecal and urate material. 
The right lung was dark red in colour and appeared congested. Both the liver and spleen were uniformly shrunken.
Melena was observed in the esophagus, proventriculus and gizzard. 


",01/03/2019,"Lung: there is marked congestion.
Liver: large numbers of Kupffer cells contain haemosiderin.
Spleen: there is a reduction in the amount of lymphoid tissue with increased proximity of sheathed arterioles. Moderate numbers of haemosiderin-laden macrophages are scattered throughout the parenchyma.
Adrenal gland: there is a subjective increase in the amount of cortical tissue
Bursa: follicles are shrunken with loss of lymphoid cells from both cortical and medullary areas, with the later often containing small aggregates of histiocytic cells.
Sections of heart show no obvious abnormalities.",,,,,,,,Moult-associated emaciation.,,,This was a juvenile male penguin who unfortunately has not put on enough weight prior to entering the moult and has succumbed to emaciation.

Frozen prior to submission.",,Pathologist 4,"The bird weighed 1.40 kg and was in poor body condition, with reduced pectoral muscle mass and minimal body fat reserves. The pectoral muscle was diffusely pale.
Both the liver and spleen were diffusely pale and uniformly shrunken and the gall bladder was moderately distended with bile. 
The proventriculus contained a small amount of mucoid dark brown material, as did multiple loops of intestine (melaena). 
No other abnormalities were noted on gross post mortem.
",04/04/2019,"Liver: large numbers of Kupffer cells contain haemosiderin.
Spleen: there are decreased amounts of lymphoid tissue with increased proximity of sheathed arterioles; freeze-thaw and autolytic artifact preclude further evaluation.
Bearing in mind the freeze-thaw and autolytic artifact, sections of lung, heart and kidney show no obvious abnormalities.",,,,,,,,Moult-associated starvation/emaciation,,,This was an adult female penguin in poor body condition post moult. Gross and histological findings were not suggestive of any concurrent Avian Malaria.
